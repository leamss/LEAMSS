## 📅 February 2026

### ✅ Phase 3A — Attendance & Leave Management (COMPLETE — backend 100% tested)
**Completed:** Feb 13, 2026
**Tests:** 23/23 backend tests passed via testing_agent_v3_fork (`/app/test_reports/iteration_92.json`)
**Test file:** `/app/backend/tests/test_phase3a_attendance_leaves.py`

#### Company Policies Implemented (configurable via /api/hr-admin/settings)
- 🕙 Office hours: 10:00 — 19:00 IST (9 hours)
- ⚠️ Late after 10 min grace (post 10:10 AM = late)
- 🚨 3 late marks/month → 1 CL auto-deducted (`record_late_mark` in attendance_logic.py)
- 📅 Monthly CL cap: 1/month (counts approved + pending)
- 🥪 Sandwich leave (Fri-Mon = 4 days incl. weekend; Sat-Mon = 3 days)
- 📏 Max 7 consecutive days leave
- 🚫 Long leave (>5 days) once per year
- ❌ No approval = LWP (auto-marked after working day with no punch + no leave)
- ⏱ Regularization grace: 3 days

#### 7 Leave Types Seeded
| Type | Quota | Monthly Cap | Max Consecutive |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Casual Leave (CL) | 12/yr | **1/month** | 1 day |
| Sick Leave (SL) | 12/yr | — | 7 days |
| Earned Leave (EL) | 24/yr | — | 7 days |
| Comp-off | earned | — | 3 days |
| LWP | unlimited | — | — |
| Maternity | 180 days | — | 180 |
| Paternity | 5 days | — | 5 |

#### Backend (3 new routers + 1 migration + 1 logic module)
- `routers/attendance.py` — punch-in/out, current-status, my-month, today, late-marks, regularization, LWP scan, dashboard
- `routers/leaves.py` — types, my-balance, validate, apply, my-history, inbox, inbox-final, decide, all, balance-history
- `routers/hr_admin.py` — settings GET/PATCH, holidays CRUD, leave-types PATCH, approver-config
- `core/attendance_logic.py` — All business logic (sandwich detection, late marks, validation, balance deduction, approver resolution, LWP marking)
- `migrations/attendance_leave_migration.py` — Seeds defaults + backfills

#### New DB Collections
- `attendance_settings` (singleton with company policies)
- `attendance_logs` (one per user per day)
- `leave_types` (7 types)
- `leave_balances` (per user/type/year — with monthly_used breakdown)
- `leave_requests` (with L1 + Final approver IDs)
- `holidays` (year-indexed)
- `late_marks_tracker` (per user per month)
- `leave_balance_history` (audit log)
- `lwp_records` (auto-marked absences)
- `attendance_regularizations` (employee disputes)

#### Frontend
- `components/attendance/PunchWidget.jsx` — punch in/out with GPS, late banner, hours progress, late marks indicator
- `pages/MyAttendance.jsx` — calendar view with color-coded statuses, late marks card, regularization modal
- `pages/MyLeaves.jsx` — balance cards, apply modal with live validation (sandwich detection in UI), history with cancel
- `pages/LeaveApprovals.jsx` — L1 / Final inbox with one-click approve/reject
- PortalWelcome — punch widget mounted at top for internal employees

#### RBAC Updates
- New permissions auto-granted to every internal role (Phase 1 migration auto-merges):
  - `attendance.clock.own`, `attendance.view.own`
  - `leave.apply.own`, `leave.view.own`
  - `profile.view.own`, `profile.update.own`
- `SELF_SERVICE_PERMISSIONS` constant in `core/rbac/seed_data.py`

#### Two-Stage Approval Workflow Verified
- Sales Exec → L1 Manager (reports_to) → Final Approver (admin or dept head, configurable)
- If user IS the L1 approver (dept head), L1 stage is skipped
- If L1 approver IS the final approver, single approval suffices
- All decisions audited, notifications sent at each stage
