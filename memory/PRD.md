# LEAMSS - Immigration Portal PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Multi-role immigration portal with React + FastAPI + MongoDB. Roles: Admin, Case Manager, Partner, Client. Expanding to a full multi-department Employee Portal with production-grade RBAC.

> **📌 Update (Feb 13, 2026):** `CHANGELOG.md` now tracks all completed phases (incl. **Phase 3A — Attendance & Leave** with full company policies). `ROADMAP.md` lists prioritized backlog. This PRD remains the static reference for original requirements.

### 🔥 Phase 6.7 Critical Bug Fixes (May 19, 2026) — User Feedback Iteration
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 10/10 regression tests PASS (`/app/test_reports/iteration_109.json`)

Sir reported 4 critical issues with screenshots from his manual testing. All fixed:
1. **Single+leftover spouse data showing +5 instead of +10**: Defense-in-depth — marital_status is now AUTHORITATIVE both at the SAVE layer (`_strip_spouse_if_single` strips stale data) AND at the rules engine layer (ignores spouse_block when not married/de_facto). DB cleanup migration ran for existing profiles.
2. **Hotel Operations Manager → Construction Project Manager (wrong)**: Added 6 missing AU occupation codes — 141311 Hotel/Motel Manager, 132111 Corporate GM (with "Operations Head" alternative_titles), 141111 Restaurant Mgr, 225113 Marketing Specialist, 225111 Advertising Specialist, 225311 PR Professional. Verified: Hotel Ops Manager now matches 132111+141311 at 100% confidence.
3. **INR fees instead of native currency**: All 8 AU skill body fees now have `fee_native: {currency, standard, [rpl|cdr|priority|...], label}`. Examples: ACS "AUD 500 / AUD 1,000-1,450 RPL", EA "AUD 1,150 standard / AUD 1,800 CDR", VETASSESS "AUD 1,225 / AUD 2,710 priority". SkillTab now shows native breakdown.
4. **Upload Resume missing from wizard**: Added Upload Resume button to EligibilityProfileWizard.jsx header. Same endpoint, deep-merges into form.
5. **AI output less detailed**: SYSTEM_PROMPT now has DEPTH EXPECTATION (4-6 sentence narrative, 3-5 sentence reasoning, 4-6 bullets each) + new RULE 4 (marital authoritative) + RULE 5 (native currency fees with RPL/CDR alternates).



### 🚀 Phase 6.7 Part 2 — Pre-Analysis Verification + Resume Upload + Client Info Sheet (May 19, 2026)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 24/24 backend tests PASS (`/app/test_reports/iteration_108.json`)

3 new sub-features layered onto the Phase 6.7 eligibility engine:

1. **Pre-Analysis Verification Page** (`/eligibility/profile/:id/verify`) — Shows a 0-100 completeness score across 8 weighted sections (Personal 12%, Profession 22%, Education 14%, Language 14%, Marital 8%, Spouse 10%, Preferences 10%, Additional 10%) with per-section warnings + blockers. Wizard's "Submit" and Profile list's "Run AI" buttons now route through this page first. Spouse section gets full credit (N/A) for single applicants — no false penalties.

2. **Resume Upload + AI Extraction** — Admin/Partner can drop a PDF/DOCX/TXT resume (up to 10MB). `pdfplumber` + `python-docx` extract text → Claude Sonnet 4.6 returns Phase 6.7-shaped JSON → wizard prefills via sessionStorage. The AI prompt explicitly forces CURRENT PROFESSION matching (e.g., "B.V.Sc graduate working as Marketing Specialist → current_profession=Marketing Specialist, field_of_study=Veterinary Science"). Resume is NOT auto-saved — fully reversible review.

3. **Client Self-Service Info Sheet** — Admin generates a public no-login link via "Send Info Sheet" modal (with WhatsApp share). Client opens `/info-sheet/:token` → fills 7-section form → submission lands in `pending_review` queue with violet banner on Profiles list. Inline "Approve" button flips status to complete. Audit trail: used_ip, used_ua, used_at, reviewed_by captured. Notifications sent to inviter.

New files: `core/profile_completeness.py`, `core/resume_extractor.py`, `routers/eligibility_info_sheet.py`, `pages/eligibility/EligibilityProfileVerify.jsx`, `pages/eligibility/PublicInfoSheet.jsx`. Routes added: `/eligibility/profile/:id/verify` (RBAC) and `/info-sheet/:token` (public).



### 🐛 Phase 6.7 Part 1 — AI Eligibility Engine Bug Fixes (May 18, 2026)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 16/16 backend tests PASS (`/app/test_reports/iteration_107.json`)

User reported during manual testing that the AI Eligibility Engine was:
1. Mixing primary applicant + spouse profiles in recommendations
2. Awarding +10 partner points just because spouse had a Master's degree (no strict gate)
3. Matching ANZSCO codes on past education (e.g., Veterinary degree) instead of current profession (e.g., Marketing Specialist)
4. UI did not visually separate "Primary Applicant Analysis" from "Spouse Information"

All 4 P0 bugs fixed. Strict Option A/B/C/D/E partner-points rules. AI prompt rewritten with 5 ABSOLUTE RULES forcing CURRENT PROFESSION matching. New ApplicantPanels component with primary/spouse separation + "PRIMARY APPLICANT ANALYSIS" divider. Schema migration endpoint available. See CHANGELOG.md for full details.




### 🎯 Phase 4D ARCHITECTURAL UNIFICATION (May 14, 2026)
- **Unified People Management** at `/admin/people` — Single source of identity for employees, partners, vendors, clients. 3-step Add Person Wizard.
- **Unified Finance Center** at `/admin/finance` — All money flows in one screen (commissions, CM earnings, vendor payouts) with period filter + CSV downloads + leaderboard.
- **Express Sale Modes** — Token Payment (lock deal with small amount) OR Direct Proposal (full amount immediately).
- 7 critical bug fixes shipped (slab delete dialog, vendor View inline, calculator empty state, invite URL prefix, CM earnings click-through, product price lock, Express ₹5,100 fix).
- Tests: 43/43 PASS in iteration_102.



### 🎯 Phase 4C UNIFICATION (May 14, 2026)
- Products + Cost Structures merged into ONE collection. Each Product carries identity, pricing, cost_allocations, success_bonuses, computed margins, and workflow steps.
- New unified UI at `/admin/products` with master-detail tabbed editor.
- PA creation form: Product is now the primary anchor field (auto-fills country/visa_type).
- Migration auto-runs on every server boot — idempotent.
- Internal vendor auto-user-creation: case_manager / sales_commission vendors auto-get user accounts on creation.
- Tests: iteration_101.json — 24/30 → critical bugs fixed.


### 🏆 PHASE 4C COMPLETE — Sales Commission + Vendor Payout Engine (May 14, 2026)
All 7 sub-phases delivered & tested:
- **4C.1** Vendor Master + Categories
- **4C.2** Product Cost Structures (5 seeded: Canada PR, Australia PR, Student Visa, UK Skilled, USA H1B)
- **4C.3** Auto-Allocation Engine (auto-triggers on `case_created`)
- **4C.4** Sales Commission Slabs (Bronze 5% · Silver 7% · Gold 10% — cumulative monthly revenue based)
- **4C.5** CM Earnings Widget (read-only, no CM workflow changes)
- **4C.6** External Vendor Portal (magic-link onboarding + self-service)
- **4C.7** Approval + Payout Workflow (bulk operations + NEFT CSV)

**Test Coverage:** iteration_99.json (27/28 — 4C.3/4C.4), iteration_100.json (36/36 — 4C.5/4C.6/4C.7 after critical filter fix).
**Test Files:** `/app/backend/tests/test_phase4c5_4c6_4c7.py` (36 cases — regression-ready).
**See CHANGELOG.md for full implementation details.**



### Phase 4A — Sales Workflow Inheritance (Feb 13, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 15/15 backend tests passed (`/app/test_reports/iteration_96.json`)

### Impersonation Restored — "Switch / View Dashboard As User" (Feb 13, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — restored original full JWT-swap impersonation (Option A)

**Why:** Prior agent had downgraded `POST /api/auth/impersonate/{user_id}` to 410 GONE in favor of a read-only modal preview. User explicitly requested original behavior back ("jaise pehle tha").

**Backend** (`routers/auth.py`):
- Endpoint un-deprecated, full JWT swap restored
- Guard-rails: admin-only (legacy + rbac_role), 400 self-impersonate, 400 inactive target, 404 missing user
- Audit log: `action='impersonate_user'` with admin_email + target_email + target_role
- Returns target's full user object + `impersonated_by` metadata

**Frontend**:
- `AdminDashboard.jsx` line 2424 Switch button → `handleImpersonate(usr)` (was `setPreviewUserId`)
- `handleImpersonate` — full route map (admin, partner, case_manager, client, sales_executive, sr_sales_executive, sales_manager, sales_head) + `/portal/welcome` fallback + error recovery
- `DashboardShell.jsx > AdminReturnBanner` — shows `🔄 Impersonating [name]` + role badge + `(Logged in as Admin: [admin])` + `Exit Impersonation` button

**Verified:**
- ✅ 5 backend guard-rails pass via curl
- ✅ Audit log entry written
- ✅ Frontend E2E: Admin → Users tab → 11 Switch buttons rendered → Click Case Manager Switch → land on /case-manager → yellow banner visible → Exit → back to /admin clean

### Phase 4A — Sales Workflow Inheritance (Feb 13, 2026) (continued)

**Design Principle:** DRY — Sales executives are treated as "internal partners" with the EXACT SAME PA workflow. No component duplication.

**Backend Foundation:**
- `_assert_pa_owner()` helper at top of `pre_assessment.py` for centralized ownership
- Module-level constants `PA_CREATOR_ROLES`, `OWN_SCOPED_ROLES`
- 14 ownership checks across 7 routers updated to allow sales roles
- New fields on PA: `created_by_user_id`, `created_by_role`, `created_by_user_type`, `lead_source`, `lead_source_detail`
- Migration `phase4a_pa_backfill.py` — 15 existing PAs backfilled idempotently
- **CRITICAL FIX**: GET /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id} now enforces ownership (was previously unrestricted)

**Frontend:**
- `/sales/dashboard` route → `<PartnerDashboard mode="sales" />` (thin wrapper, full workflow reuse)
- 4 placeholder widgets (`SalesWidgetsRow`) above PartnerHome: Target/Commission/Rank/Followups with "Coming in Phase 4X" badges
- `/sales/coming-soon?feature={key}` placeholder page
- Login redirect: 4 internal sales roles → `/sales/dashboard`
- Lead Source dropdown (10 options) at TOP of PA creation form
- Partner workflow EXACTLY unchanged

**Permissions:**
- `sales_executive` role now has 28 permissions (18 partner perms + 10 sales/self-service)
- Added: `agreement.view.own`, `agreement.generate.own`, `invoice.view.own`

### Phase 3B — HR Admin Settings UI (Feb 13, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 42/42 backend tests passed (19 new + 23 Phase 3A regression — `/app/test_reports/iteration_93.json`)

**4 Admin Pages Built (+ 1 audit log viewer):**
- `/admin/hr/settings` — Attendance Settings (5 collapsible sections with live previews)
- `/admin/hr/holidays` — Holiday Calendar Manager (list + calendar views + bulk import/copy/export)
- `/admin/hr/leave-types` — Leave Types & Policies (7-card grid + custom type creator)
- `/admin/hr/approvers` — Approval Configuration with **visual chain simulator**
- `/admin/hr/audit` — Policy Change Audit Log (scope filter + before/after diff)

**Backend Additions (`routers/hr_admin.py` — prefix renamed `/hr-admin` → `/hr`):**
- POST /api/hr/leave-types (create custom), DELETE /api/hr/leave-types/{key}
- POST /api/hr/holidays/import-indian/{year}, POST /api/hr/holidays/copy-from/{from}/to/{to}
- GET/PATCH /api/hr/approvers/config (advanced rules: skip-L1, self-approve, auto-approve, escalation)
- GET /api/hr/approvers/simulate/{user_id} — visual chain preview
- GET /api/hr/audit-log — `policy_audit_log` collection

### Phase 3A — Attendance & Leave Management (Feb 13, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 23/23 backend tests passed (`/app/test_reports/iteration_92.json`)

**Company Policies (configurable via /api/hr-admin/settings):**
- Office hours: 10:00 — 19:00 IST (9 hours), 10-min grace
- 3 late marks/month → 1 CL auto-deducted
- Monthly CL cap: 1/month (counts pending + approved)
- Sandwich leave (Fri-Mon = 4 days incl. weekend)
- Max 7 consecutive days, long leave (>5d) once/year
- No approval = LWP (regularization grace: 3 days)
- 7 leave types: CL/SL/EL/Comp-off/LWP/Maternity/Paternity
- 2-stage approval workflow: L1 Manager → Final Approver (configurable)

**Implementation:**
- Backend: 3 new routers + 1 logic module + 1 migration (`attendance_leave_migration.py`)
- Frontend: PunchWidget + MyAttendance calendar + MyLeaves balance/apply + LeaveApprovals inbox
- 10 new DB collections + 6 new RBAC permissions auto-granted to internal roles

### RBAC Phase 2.2 — Route Guard Bug Fix (2026-05-13)

**Reported by user via screenshots:** A sr_sales_executive user was accessing `/admin/employees` and getting 403 errors from backend when trying admin actions (Reset Password, Change Role). UI was confusing — actions were visible but failed.

**Root cause:** No frontend route guard. `EmployeesPortal.jsx` only checked `if (!token)`. Any valid token allowed access, then backend correctly returned 403 when user lacked permissions.

**Fix:**
1. **Created** `/app/frontend/src/components/RequirePermission.jsx` — declarative route guard
   - Matches backend `PermissionService` logic (wildcard, resource wildcard, scope hierarchy all > dept > team > own)
   - Props: `anyOf=[]` (permissions), `allowRoles=[]` (role keys), `fallback`
   - On deny: toast "Access denied" + redirect to user's natural dashboard
2. **Applied to** `/admin/employees` route in `App.js`:
   ```jsx
   <RequirePermission anyOf={['employee.view.all', 'user.view.all']} allowRoles={['admin_owner', 'admin']}>
   ```
3. **Defense in depth** — Inside `EmployeeDetailModal`, admin-only buttons (Reset Pwd, Deactivate, Change Role, Edit Profile) are now conditionally hidden/disabled based on logged-in user's `permissions[]`

**Verified:**
- ✅ sr_sales_executive → `/admin/employees` → blocked + redirected to `/portal/welcome` with toast
- ✅ admin → `/admin/employees` → full Employees Dashboard renders normally
- ✅ Even if a non-admin somehow reaches modal, all admin-only buttons hidden

### RBAC Phase 2.1 — Critical Fixes Complete (2026-05-13)

All 4 critical issues resolved & tested. Phase 2 is now **production-ready**.

#### Issue #1: Login Redirect (P0 — Blocking)
- **Root cause**: `Login.jsx` had hardcoded `roleRoutes` map with only 4 keys. New role types (sales_executive, hr_executive etc.) hit fallback → infinite login loop.
- **Fix**: Smart redirect via `rbac_role || role`. New role types → `/portal/welcome` (shared placeholder).
- **New page**: `PortalWelcome.jsx` — adaptive dashboard rendering user's ui_modules as cards, dept-themed banner, live clock, real notification count.

#### Issue #2: View Dashboard As User (P1)
- **Removed**: `/api/auth/impersonate` returns 410 GONE (with use_instead pointer).
- **New endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/dashboard-preview` — read-only, no session switch.
- **New UI**: `DashboardPreviewModal` — warning banner ("Read-only · Action logged"), shows target's modules as preview cards, toast on click.
- **Audit**: Every preview logged to `activity_log` with action `viewed_dashboard_as_user`.

#### Issue #3: Role Change Enhancements (P3)
- **Backend** `PATCH /api/employees/{id}/role` enhanced:
  - Accepts optional `new_designation`, `effective_date`, `new_department`
  - Validates reason ≥ 20 chars
  - Auto-clears `reports_to` if old manager invalid for new role
  - History entry includes `changed_from_detail` + `changed_to_detail` structured snapshots
- **UI**: Enhanced "Change Role" dialog with summary card showing permission count delta + reports_to reset warning + auto-fill designation
- **New tab**: "Role History" in EmployeeDetailModal — timeline view with arrows, structured detail, audit info

#### Issue #4: Password Reset Structure (P2)
**A) `must_change_password_on_next_login` Flag**
- Auto-set when admin resets password
- Login response includes the flag
- `Login.jsx` redirects to `/force-change-password` if true
- New page: `ForceChangePassword.jsx` — blocks all access until new password set

**B) Password Strength Validation**
- Backend `validate_password_strength()` — 8+ chars, upper, lower, digit, special
- Frontend: `PasswordStrengthMeter.jsx` — real-time 5-bar meter with rule checklist
- Used in: change-password, reset-with-token, force-change-password

**C) Force-Logout Other Sessions**
- JWT now includes `iat` (issued-at)
- User has `password_changed_at` field
- `get_current_user` rejects tokens where `iat < password_changed_at`
- Triggered automatically on every password change

**D) Forgot Password Flow (Public)**
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` — always returns success (no email enumeration); generates 72h magic link; logs URL to console (Resend MOCKED)
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password-with-token` — validates token + expiry + reuse check; sets new password with strength validation
- New pages: `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password?token=XYZ`
- Login page: "Forgot Password?" link added

**E) Enhanced Admin Reset Password Modal**
- 3 delivery modes: `show_once` / `email` (MOCKED) / `magic_link` (72h)
- Reason field (required, min 10 chars)
- Sets `must_change_password_on_next_login = true`
- Audit logged to `activity_log`

**F) Password History**
- `password_history` field stores last 3 hashes
- Cannot reuse current OR any of last 3 passwords

**Files Created (5):**
- `/app/backend/routers/admin_users.py` — dashboard-preview + enhanced reset-password
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ForgotPassword.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ResetPasswordWithToken.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ForceChangePassword.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/PasswordStrengthMeter.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/DashboardPreviewModal.jsx`

**Files Modified (7):**
- `/app/backend/core/auth.py` — JWT iat, password strength validator, force-logout check
- `/app/backend/routers/auth.py` — login returns must_change flag, /change-password strength+history+force-logout, /forgot-password, /reset-password-with-token, /impersonate→410
- `/app/backend/routers/employees.py` — /role accepts effective_date+designation+validation
- `/app/backend/server.py` — registered admin_users router
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` — must_change redirect, forgot link
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` — 3 new routes (forgot, reset, force-change)
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/EmployeeDetailModal.jsx` — View Dashboard button, Role History tab, enhanced reset/role dialogs
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` — removed Impersonate button

**Backend Test Results — ALL PASS ✅:**
```
═══ ISSUE #2 — Dashboard Preview ═══
  ✓ Preview returns user data WITHOUT token (modules=13)
  ✓ Old /impersonate returns 410 GONE
  ✓ Activity log entry created

═══ ISSUE #3 — Role Change ═══
  ✓ Reason < 20 chars rejected
  ✓ Role change accepts effective_date + new_designation
  ✓ History has structured changed_to_detail

═══ ISSUE #4 — Password Reset ═══
  ✓ show_once: returns temp password + must_change flag
  ✓ Login returns must_change_password_on_next_login=true
  ✓ Weak password rejected (8+ chars, upper, lower, digit, special)
  ✓ Strong password accepted, must_change cleared
  ✓ Force-logout: old token invalidated after password change
  ✓ magic_link: 72h token issued
  ✓ reset-password-with-token works
  ✓ Reused token rejected
  ✓ /forgot-password always returns success (no enumeration)
  ✓ Cannot reuse same password
```

**Frontend Smoke Tests — ALL PASS ✅:**
- ✓ Login page has "Forgot Password?" link
- ✓ `/forgot-password` page renders
- ✓ `/reset-password?token=XYZ` page renders with strength meter
- ✓ All 4 existing logins still work

### RBAC Phase 2 — Employee Portal UI Complete (2026-05-13)

**Dedicated Employee Portal at `/admin/employees`** — separate page using DashboardShell layout. Entry-point: green "Employee Portal" button on Admin Home greeting card.

**New Pages (5):**
1. **Employees Dashboard** (`emp-dashboard`) — top stat cards (Total/Active/On Leave/New This Month), department breakdown bars, recently joined list, quick actions
2. **Departments** (`emp-departments`) — 8 department cards with icon/color/employee count/head, edit dialog for name/description/head
3. **All Employees** (`emp-list`) — searchable filterable table (Department, Role, Status), CSV export, row → opens detail modal
4. **Add Employee** (`emp-add`) — 3-step stepper (Basic Info → Employment → Access & Security), auto-2FA for hierarchy_level >= 3, shows temp password once
5. **Org Chart** (`emp-org-chart`) — hierarchical tree from `reports_to` with expand/collapse, department-color borders

**Employee Detail Modal** with 3 tabs:
- **Profile** — inline edit (name, mobile, designation, location, work mode), direct reports widget
- **Role & Permissions** — current role with permissions/UI modules display, change role dialog (logs to `user_role_history`), full role-change history
- **Activity** — recent 30 activity log entries
- Header actions: Reset Password, Deactivate/Reactivate

**Backend Endpoints (15):**
- `GET /api/employees` — list with filters (department, role, status, search) + pagination
- `GET /api/employees/stats` — dashboard counts + dept/role breakdowns
- `GET /api/employees/recent` — recent joiners
- `GET /api/employees/org-chart` — hierarchical tree
- `GET /api/employees/{id}` — detail with manager + direct_reports
- `GET /api/employees/{id}/history` — role change audit
- `GET /api/employees/{id}/activity` — activity log
- `POST /api/employees` — create with all RBAC fields populated, auto-gen LMS-2026-NNNN
- `PATCH /api/employees/{id}` — update profile
- `PATCH /api/employees/{id}/role` — change role + refresh perms + log history + notify user
- `POST /api/employees/{id}/deactivate` — terminate
- `POST /api/employees/{id}/reactivate` — restore
- `POST /api/employees/{id}/reset-password` — generate new temp password
- `GET /api/departments` — list with employee counts + head
- `GET /api/departments/{key}` — detail
- `GET /api/departments/{key}/employees` — employees in dept
- `GET /api/departments/{key}/roles` — roles available for dept
- `PATCH /api/departments/{key}` — update name/desc/head
- `GET /api/departments/_meta/roles` — all internal roles cross-dept

**All endpoints gated by RBAC Phase 1 permissions:**
- View: `employee.view.all` OR `user.view.all` OR `employee.view.dept`
- Create: `employee.create.any` OR `user.create.any`
- Update: `employee.update.all` OR `user.update.any`
- Terminate: `employee.terminate.any`

**Files Created (8):**
- `/app/backend/routers/employees.py` — 13 endpoints, ~400 lines
- `/app/backend/routers/departments.py` — 5 endpoints, ~130 lines
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/EmployeesPortal.jsx` — DashboardShell wrapper with lazy-loaded children
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/EmployeesDashboard.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/DepartmentsPage.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/EmployeesList.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/AddEmployeeForm.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/OrgChart.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/employees/EmployeeDetailModal.jsx`

**Files Modified (3):**
- `/app/backend/server.py` — registered employees + departments routers
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` — new route `/admin/employees`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/AdminHome.jsx` — "Employee Portal" button on greeting card

**Backend Fixes During Implementation:**
- `routers/auth.py` `/login` endpoint now returns ALL RBAC fields (rbac_role, user_type, department, permissions, ui_modules, employee_id, partner_code, two_fa_enabled) — previously only login response missed the upgrade

**Critical Technical Note — Babel Stack Overflow Workaround:**
- AdminDashboard.jsx is already 3370+ lines. Adding new imports for shadcn-heavy components (Dialog, Select) triggered `Maximum call stack size exceeded` in the platform's visual-edits babel plugin (`subtreeHasPortals` recursive AST analysis).
- **Resolution**: Built Employee Portal as a STANDALONE page route (`/admin/employees`) instead of merging into AdminDashboard sidebar. Used `React.lazy` for sub-components so dynamic imports skip the recursive AST scanner.
- **Result**: AdminDashboard untouched (0 regressions). Employee Portal works seamlessly via dedicated route.

**Test Validation:**
- ✅ All 4 existing logins work unchanged
- ✅ Created test employees → got LMS-2026-NNNN, permissions[], ui_modules[] populated
- ✅ New employee login returns full RBAC fields
- ✅ All 5 portal pages render
- ✅ Lint clean on backend (3 files) + frontend (6 components + 1 page)

### RBAC Phase 1 — Foundation Complete (2026-05-12 night)

**User-approved Phase 1 RBAC foundation built end-to-end** — backward-compatible, zero regressions.

**8 new MongoDB collections seeded:**
- `departments` (8): admin, sales, marketing, operations, hr, accounts, it, compliance
- `roles` (18 system roles): admin_owner, compliance_officer, sales_head, sales_manager, sr_sales_executive, sales_executive, partner, marketing_head, marketing_executive, ops_head, case_manager, doc_verifier, hr_head, hr_executive, accounts_head, accounts_executive, it_admin, client
- `permissions` (219 entries) — naming: `{resource}.{action}.{scope}` + wildcard `*` for owner
- `teams` (empty, ready for use)
- `user_role_history` (audit trail)
- `migrations` (auto-logs every migration run)

**Users collection extended (backward-compatible):**
- Legacy `role` field **PRESERVED** (admin/partner/case_manager/client) — no existing route breaks
- NEW `rbac_role` (admin_owner/partner/case_manager/client + 14 more keys for future)
- NEW: `user_type`, `department`, `designation`, `reports_to`, `team_id`, `permissions[]`, `ui_modules[]`, `custom_permissions_granted[]`, `custom_permissions_revoked[]`
- Internal employees: `employee_id` (LMS-2026-NNNN), `date_of_joining`, `employment_status`, `employment_type`, `work_mode`
- External partners: `partner_code` (PRT-NNNN), `commission_tier`, `partner_agreement_signed`
- Security: `two_fa_enabled`, `two_fa_secret`, `failed_login_count`, `account_locked_until`
- Profile: `avatar_url`, `emergency_contact`

**Permission Service** (`/app/backend/core/rbac/permission_service.py`):
- `has_permission` / `has_any_permission` / `has_all_permissions`
- Wildcard `*` for admin_owner — passes ANY check
- Resource wildcards: `pa.*`, `pa.view.*`
- Hierarchical scope: `all > dept > team > own` (team scope passes own checks)
- Custom overrides: `effective = (role.permissions + custom_granted) − custom_revoked`
- Resource-level scope check (own/team/dept) against actual document fields
- `refresh_user_permissions(user_id)` — recompute cached perms on role change

**FastAPI Dependencies** (`/app/backend/core/rbac/dependencies.py`):
- `require_permission("pa.approve.l2")` — single check
- `require_any_permission(*keys)` / `require_all_permissions(*keys)`
- `require_role(*role_keys)` (honors both legacy + rbac_role)
- `require_department(*dept_keys)`
- `get_resource_with_permission(collection, id, perm_key, user)` — fetch + scope check in one call
- 403 errors return structured body: `{error, message, required, your_role}`

**Migration** (`/app/backend/migrations/rbac_phase1_migration.py`):
- Idempotent — safe on every boot (auto-runs in `server.py` startup)
- Seeds depts/perms/roles via upsert by `key`
- Backfills existing users:
  - admin → rbac_role=admin_owner, user_type=internal, dept=admin
  - partner → rbac_role=partner, user_type=external, dept=sales
  - case_manager → rbac_role=case_manager, user_type=internal, dept=operations
  - client → rbac_role=client, user_type=client, dept=null
- Auto-generates LMS-2026-NNNN / PRT-NNNN with no collisions
- Logs each run in `migrations` collection

**Auth Updates:**
- `build_token_payload(user)` — JWT now includes `rbac_role`, `user_type`, `department`, `permissions[]`
- `/api/auth/me` returns: legacy `role` + new `rbac_role`, `user_type`, `department`, `permissions`, `ui_modules`, `employee_id`/`partner_code`, `two_fa_enabled`, `emergency_contact`, etc.
- `/api/auth/login` response enriched with same fields
- Existing `current_user["role"] == "admin"` checks across 100+ routes still work — ZERO migration needed in Phase 1

**Indexes added** (idempotent):
- users: `(user_type, department, rbac_role)` compound, `reports_to`, `team_id`, `employment_status`, `employee_id` unique sparse, `partner_code` unique sparse
- roles: `key` unique, `(department, hierarchy_level)`
- permissions: `key` unique, `(resource, action)`
- departments: `key` unique
- teams: `department`, `manager_id`
- user_role_history: `(user_id, effective_date desc)`

**Acceptance Tests — ALL PASS:**
1. ✅ admin@leamss.com: /auth/me → role=admin, rbac_role=admin_owner, user_type=internal, dept=admin, employee_id=LMS-2026-0001, permissions=["*"]
2. ✅ partner@leamss.com: rbac_role=partner, user_type=external, dept=sales, partner_code=PRT-0001, 18 perms
3. ✅ manager@leamss.com: rbac_role=case_manager, user_type=internal, dept=operations, employee_id=LMS-2026-0002, 11 perms
4. ✅ client@leamss.com: rbac_role=client, user_type=client, dept=null, 8 perms (incl. pa.view.own, agreement.sign.own)
5. ✅ Regression: /api/users, /api/products, /api/cases, /api/legal-archive/stats (admin only — 403 for partner) all working
6. ✅ Permission service: admin "*" passes any check; partner has pa.create.own but NOT pa.approve.l1; scope hierarchy (team>=own) works; client denied legal_archive; has_any/has_all logic; custom grant/revoke overrides
7. ✅ Idempotency: 2nd run of migration → 0 duplicate inserts, 0 re-backfills

**Files created (7):**
- `/app/backend/core/rbac/__init__.py`
- `/app/backend/core/rbac/models.py` — Pydantic models for new collections
- `/app/backend/core/rbac/seed_data.py` — 8 depts + 219 perms + 18 roles definitions
- `/app/backend/core/rbac/permission_service.py` — Core check logic
- `/app/backend/core/rbac/dependencies.py` — FastAPI deps
- `/app/backend/migrations/__init__.py`
- `/app/backend/migrations/rbac_phase1_migration.py` — Idempotent seed + backfill + indexes

**Files modified (4):**
- `/app/backend/core/database.py` — added 6 new collection handles
- `/app/backend/core/auth.py` — `build_token_payload()` helper for RBAC-aware JWT
- `/app/backend/routers/auth.py` — `/login`, `/auth/me`, `/impersonate` return RBAC fields
- `/app/backend/server.py` — auto-runs migration on startup

**What's NOT touched (preserved):**
- All existing routes still use legacy `role` field — no regression
- Frontend code unchanged — login UI still renders correctly
- All existing PA workflow, AI proposals, agreements, legal archive intact

### Rollback — In-House Sales Team CRM Removed (2026-05-12 evening)

**User feedback**: In-House Partner concept + Sales Team Manager Dashboard didn't align with the bigger vision. User wants a proper **Employee Portal** instead (with departments, attendance, payroll, etc.) — planned as next major build.

**Removed cleanly** (no git revert; manual removal so existing features stayed intact):
- `/app/backend/routers/sales_team.py` — deleted
- `/app/frontend/src/components/sales/` (3 components) — deleted
- `users.py`: removed `employment_type` + `manager_id` fields from create/update
- `server.py`: removed sales_team_router import + mount
- `AdminDashboard.jsx`: removed Sales Team sidebar item + render + sales_manager role option + employment_type badge in Users list + employment_type dropdown in user dialog
- `PartnerDashboard.jsx`: removed Team Dashboard conditional sidebar item + sales_manager auth + sales-team render + auto-land
- `AdminHome.jsx`: removed DiscountApprovalInbox
- `PartnerHome.jsx`: removed IncentiveTierWidget
- `Login.jsx`: removed sales_manager route mapping
- DB cleanup: dropped `discount_requests`, `incentive_configs`, `sales_targets` collections; stripped `employment_type`/`manager_id` from users; deleted `salesmgr@leamss.com` user

**Verified**: 404 on `/api/sales-team/*`, clean Users page, existing Admin/Partner/Case Manager/Client flows untouched. Lint clean across modified files.

### In-House Sales Team CRM — Phase 1 + 2 (2026-05-12)

**User-approved P1**: Build foundation + Discount Approval + Tiered Incentive for in-house sales reps. Phase 3 (full Manager Dashboard) next round.

**Phase 1 — Foundation**:
- `users` collection: new `employment_type` field (values: `external` (default) | `employee`) + `manager_id` field
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` accepts both fields with validation
- `POST /api/users` defaults `employment_type=external`
- Admin Users page (AdminDashboard.jsx):
  - New badge column showing 🏢 In-House / 🌍 External next to partner names (data-testid=emp-type-{userId})
  - Edit/Create dialog: new indigo-bordered "Employment Type" dropdown (data-testid=user-employment-type) — appears only when role=partner
  - Explanatory text: "In-house employees get tiered incentives + stricter discount cap (5% vs 10%) and visibility to managers"

**Phase 2 — Discount Approval + Incentive**:
- New router `/app/backend/routers/sales_team.py` mounted at `/api/sales-team` (renamed from `/sales` to avoid existing route conflict)
- Auto-seeded tier config in `incentive_configs` collection:
  - Tiers: Bronze (0-5L @ 5%), Silver (5-15L @ 7%), Gold (15L+ @ 10%)
  - Discount caps: employee 5% auto / 15% manager / 100% admin; external 10% auto / 100% admin
- `POST /api/sales-team/discount-requests` — auto-routes based on % + employment_type. Returns `auto_approved=true` if within cap, else `status=pending` with `level_required`
- `GET /api/sales-team/discount-requests?status=` — admin/manager see all, partner/rep see own
- `POST /api/sales-team/discount-requests/{id}/decide` — approve/reject with optional note; managers blocked from admin-level requests
- `GET /api/sales-team/my-incentive?month=YYYY-MM` — employee-only; aggregates current rep's revenue from closed deals (`proposal_paid` / `awaiting_final_approval` / `case_created` stages), returns current tier + base_payout + next_tier + delta_needed
- `GET /api/sales-team/team-rollup` — admin sees all employees, sales_manager sees own team (by manager_id)
- `GET /api/sales-team/incentive-config` & `PUT /api/sales-team/incentive-config` — admin can adjust tiers/caps; versioning auto-bumps

**Frontend**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/sales/IncentiveTierWidget.jsx` — mounted on PartnerHome. Gold-gradient tier banner + revenue/deals/commission stats + progress bar to next tier. **Auto-hides for externals** (403 response).
- `/app/frontend/src/components/sales/DiscountApprovalInbox.jsx` — mounted on AdminHome. Pending requests with level badge (auto/manager/admin), employment_type tag, base→discount→final breakdown, optional decision note, Approve/Reject buttons.

**Verified via curl + screenshots**:
- 3% discount → auto_approved instantly (within 5% cap)
- 10% discount → pending, level_required='manager'
- 25% discount → pending, level_required='admin'
- Approve flow works, status updates correctly
- Incentive: ₹2.98L revenue → Bronze tier → ₹14,948 payout, ₹2.01L to Silver visible
- External 403 on incentive endpoint (correct gate)
- Team rollup returns 1 employee rep with revenue + tier
- Frontend: badges render, incentive widget shows on PartnerHome, discount inbox shows on AdminHome

### Active Share Links Dashboard (2026-05-12)

**User-approved potential improvement** following smart-link + expiry control. Compliance + security gold-tier feature.

**Backend**:
- New router `/app/backend/routers/share_links_dashboard.py` mounted at `/api/share-links`
- `GET /api/share-links/?status=&link_type=&search=` (admin only) — unified list of all share-tokens + magic-tokens across all PAs with metadata: issuer, purpose, amount_label, issued_at, expires_at, status (active/expired/revoked/consumed/deactivated), access_count, last_accessed_at/ip/ua, and a `suspicious` flag (heuristic: clicks≥5 while still active)
- `POST /api/share-links/revoke` — admin sets `share_active=false` (for public) or `revoked=true` (for magic) with audit fields: revoked_at/by/reason
- Click tracking added to `GET /pre-assess-portal/public/{token}` — auto-increments `share_click_count` and records `share_last_accessed_at/ip/ua` per visit
- Magic links capture `used_ip/used_ua` on consume + check `revoked` flag (returns 410 'Link revoked by admin')

**Frontend**:
- New component `/app/frontend/src/components/ShareLinksDashboard.jsx` — full audit table with stats strip, search, type filter, click-to-revoke flow with reason capture, suspicious badges, color-coded status pills
- Mounted on AdminHome as third bottom widget (`id=share-links-anchor`)
- New Quick Access tile `quick-share-links-anchor` with indigo accent + smooth-scroll to widget

**Verified visually**: 30 links rendered, filter to "active" shows 15, revoke dialog opens cleanly with reason input. Stats update live after revoke (1 → revoked column).

### Smart Share Link + Expiry Control (2026-05-08)

**User-reported issue + enhancement combined**:

**Issue**: WhatsApp / Copy Public Link button always generated ₹5,100 PA-fee link, even on PAs that were already past `proposal_sent` (where client should pay the proposal fee, e.g., ₹1,50,000). User specifically complained that for an `approved + proposal_sent` PA with proposal fee ₹1,50,000, the share link was still showing ₹5,100.

**Enhancement**: Configurable link expiry (1/7/30/90 days or never).

**Backend** — `/app/backend/routers/pre_assess_portal.py`:
- `GenerateLinkRequest` model gains `expires_in_days: Optional[int]` (allowed values: 0, 1, 7, 30, 90)
- `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/generate-public-link` now branches by stage:
  - **BRANCH A** — fee NOT paid → public share-token URL (`/pre-assess/{token}`), `link_type: 'public_pa_fee'`, `amount: 5100`, `amount_label: '₹5,100'`, `purpose: 'pre_assessment_fee'`
  - **BRANCH B1** — fee paid + `proposal_sent` + linked user → magic-link URL (`/magic/{token}`), `link_type: 'magic_portal'`, `amount: pa.proposal_fee`, `purpose: 'proposal_fee_payment'`
  - **BRANCH B2** — `case_created` + linked → `purpose: 'view_portal'`, `amount: 0`
  - **BRANCH B3** — fee paid but no client_user_id → 400 'Client account not linked yet'
- Expiry honored: `expires_in_days=0` → null `expires_at` for public links, 5-year-out for magic links
- Activity log captures `action='share_link_generated'` with `type` + `expires_in_days` metadata

**Frontend** — `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/PaActionBar.jsx` (full rewrite):
- Both **Copy Public Link** and **WhatsApp** buttons now open a unified dialog (`data-testid=share-dialog-{paId}`)
- 5 expiry option pills (`data-testid=expiry-1, expiry-7, expiry-30, expiry-90, expiry-0`)
- Default = 30 days
- Amber warning banner when "Never expire" selected ("Use only for trusted recipients")
- WhatsApp message text adapts by `purpose`: shows ₹1,50,000 for proposal flows, ₹5,100 for new PAs, "View case status" for case_created
- Dialog also shows generated link with copy+open icons after submission

**Verified**: iteration_91.json — Backend **14/14 PASS** · Frontend **100% PASS** · 0 regressions across previous flows.

### Bug Fix + Edit PA Details (2026-05-08)

**User-reported issues**:
1. **🚨 BUG**: "Forward to Admin" throwing `ReferenceError: pas is not defined` — broke 3 critical handlers (forward / send-proposal / submit-final)
2. **📝 GAP**: No way to edit PA contact details (mobile/email/name) after creation — blocked WhatsApp share for PAs created without mobile

**Bug fix**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/PreAssessmentPipeline.jsx` — state was named `assessments`/`setAssessments`, but 9 lines across 3 handlers (`handleForwardToAdmin`, `handleSendProposal`, `handleSubmitFinal`) used the wrong identifiers `pas`/`setPas`
- All 9 occurrences renamed correctly
- Forward / Proposal / Final flows now work end-to-end without errors

**New: Edit PA Details**:
- `POST → PUT /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/details` — `PADetailsUpdate` Pydantic model accepts: client_name, client_email, client_mobile, client_age, education, work_experience, country, service_type, notes
- Authorization: admin (any), partner (own only), case_manager (any), client (forbidden 403)
- Locked when stage = `case_created` (returns 400 — case must be edited from Case page)
- Diff-detection: only changed fields are persisted, returns `{ok: true, no_change: true}` when nothing different
- Auto-syncs `client_name` + `client_mobile` to linked `users` collection (so client login still works)
- Audit trail via `log_activity` with full before/after diff

**Frontend**:
- New `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/PaEditDetailsModal.jsx` — 8 grid fields + notes textarea + amber "case is locked" warning banner
- Pencil icon button (`data-testid=edit-pa-{paId}`) in every PA card row header — sits next to "Preview as Client"
- Modal applies optimistic UI update (assessment list refreshes immediately on save)

**Tested**: iteration_90.json — Backend **11/11 PASS** (1 skipped: no proposal_paid PA available) · Frontend **100% PASS** · 0 regressions across send-proposal / submit-final / forward / WhatsApp flows. `retest_needed:false`.

### Public Lead-Gen + Doc Expiry + WhatsApp Share (2026-05-08)

**4 user-approved features built and tested**:

- `GET /api/eligibility/share/{score_id}` — public shareable result
- Lead capture: when `consent_to_contact=true` + email/mobile provided → auto-creates entry in `leads` collection with priority based on top score (>=70 = high)
- New page `/app/frontend/src/pages/EligibilityCheck.jsx` mounted at `/eligibility` route — public, no login required
- 90-second form → loading state → 8 pathway cards with score bars + tier badges + strengths/gaps + share/re-score/compare CTAs

- `PUT /api/doc-expiry/pa-doc/{doc_id}/expiry` — set/update expiry on PA doc
- Idempotency: `doc_expiry_alerts` collection logs (doc_id, bucket) so same alert never fires twice
- Severity buckets: expired / critical (≤15d) / warning (≤60d) / info (≤90d) / ok
- New `DocExpiryWidget.jsx` mounted on AdminHome with 4 stat cells + Refresh + Send Alerts buttons
- Role scoping: admin/CM see all, partner sees own PAs, client sees own

#### #3 — WhatsApp Smart Share (zero-cost velocity)
- Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/PaActionBar.jsx` — added green-bordered `MessageCircle` button
- `data-testid=whatsapp-share-{paId}` between "Copy Public Link" and "Preview as Client"
- Opens `https://wa.me/{cleanMobile}?text={prefilled}` with auto-built message: client name, partner name, country/service, PA reference, fee amount, secure link, signature

#### #8 — Visa Pathway Comparison (PUBLIC + admin-editable)
- New router `/app/backend/routers/visa_compare.py`
- 8 seeded pathways with realistic 2026 fees/timelines (Canada EE/PNP, Australia 189/190, UK SW, Germany Blue Card, USA EB2-NIW, NZ SMC)
- `GET /api/visa-compare/pathways[?country=]` — public list (auto-seeds if empty)
- `GET /api/visa-compare/compare?slugs=` — 2-4 pathways side-by-side
- `PUT /api/visa-compare/pathways/{slug}` — admin edits (yearly fee refresh)
- `POST /api/visa-compare/reseed` — admin reset to defaults
- New page `/app/frontend/src/pages/VisaCompare.jsx` at `/visa-compare` — public, 8 pickable pills (max 4) → side-by-side cards with timeline / total cost / settlement funds / education / work-exp / age / language / benefits / drawbacks / post-arrival jobs

#### Login page — public access tiles
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` — added 2 gradient tiles below demo creds: `public-eligibility-link` → /eligibility, `public-compare-link` → /visa-compare

**Tested**: iteration_89.json — Backend **18/18 PASS** · Frontend 100% PASS · 0 issues · 0 regressions. `retest_needed:false`.

### PreAssessmentPipeline Refactor — Round 2 (2026-05-07 night)

**User-approved P2 task**: Further break down `PreAssessmentPipeline.jsx` (was 1066 → 1002 after Round 1).

**6 new sub-components extracted** to `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/`:
- `PaProposalForm.jsx` (131 lines) — Send Service Proposal form with promo, discount, upsell bundles, AI generation buttons (Sonnet 4.6 + Opus 4.6 Premium), live breakdown panel
- `PaDocumentsList.jsx` (92 lines) — Client Documents panel with view (inline)/download/delete handlers per file
- `PaFinalSubmitForm.jsx` (64 lines) — Receipt + Agreement upload + Submit-to-Admin form (proposal_paid → awaiting_final_approval transition)
- `PaForwardForm.jsx` (27 lines) — Partner-review remarks form
- `PaStageProgress.jsx` (23 lines) — Bottom horizontal stage indicator with 7 dots
- `PaActionBar.jsx` (23 lines) — Copy Public Link + Preview as Client + dynamic next-action button

**Result**:
- `PreAssessmentPipeline.jsx`: 1066 → **770 lines** (-296, ~28% reduction)
- All data-testids preserved across extracted components
- Cleaned unused lucide imports (IndianRupee, ArrowRight, Download)
- New `/pa/` directory now houses 8 focused sub-components (Pipeline parent + 8 children)

**Tested**: iteration_88.json — Frontend **100% PASS** · Zero regressions across all PA flows (create/expand/proposal/forward/final-submit/agreement). `retest_needed:false`.

### Compliance Report PDF (2026-05-07 night)

**User-approved enhancement** following SHA-256 tamper detection: a stamped PDF audit report for legal/audit officers.

**Backend** — `GET /api/legal-archive/compliance-report.pdf?start_date=&end_date=` (admin-only):
- ReportLab-rendered A4 PDF (~3-5 KB typical, scales linearly with records)
- Sections: Cover (window, generator, totals) → Integrity scan summary (verified/tampered/unverified counts + flagged records list) → Consents table → E-Signatures table → Invoices table → Report-level SHA-256 chain hash binding all record hashes + timestamp + officer ID
- Default window = last 90 days; configurable via query params
- Returns `X-Report-Hash` header with the binding SHA-256 for client display
- Each table includes the per-record SHA-256 hash prefix
- Footer: page numbers + "LEAMSS · Compliance Report · timestamp" on every page
- 403 enforced for non-admin

**Frontend** — `/app/frontend/src/components/LegalArchive.jsx`:
- New "Compliance Report" gradient button in header (data-testid=`compliance-report-btn`) next to Verify Integrity
- Dialog (data-testid=`compliance-report-dialog`) with From/To date pickers (default last 90d), feature description list, Generate button
- On click: streams PDF, opens in new tab, toast shows first 16 chars of report hash for instant verification

**Verified via curl**:
- Admin default → HTTP 200 + valid `%PDF-1.4` magic + 4.3 KB + correct headers
- Admin custom range → HTTP 200 + 3.2 KB
- Partner → HTTP 403 ("Admin only — Legal Archive is restricted to compliance officers")
- Anonymous → HTTP 403

### SHA-256 Tamper Detection + Legal Doc Polish + PA Refactor (2026-05-07 night)

**User asked**: 1️⃣ Re-seed agreement templates so generated UI/PDF matches uploaded DOCX verbatim with proper typography. 2️⃣ Add SHA-256 tamper detection (Task C). 3️⃣ Refactor PreAssessmentPipeline.jsx (Task D).

**Templates re-seeded** (v2): `seed_agreement_templates.py` re-run — Australia Standard, Australia Protection, Canada Express Entry now have verbatim DOCX text with structured `<h1 class=title>`, `<h2>` annexure heads, `<ul>`/`<table class="client-details">`/`<table class="fee-table">`/`<table class="signature-table">`.

**New shared CSS** `/app/frontend/src/components/agreement-doc.css` — legal-document grade typography:
- Serif font stack (Georgia, Times New Roman, Cambria), 13.5px / 1.7 line-height, justified paragraphs
- Centered title with double-rule underline, italic meta line
- H2 sections with teal left-rule and uppercase tracking; H3 with underline
- Client-details + fee-table with bordered cells, teal header on fee-table, zebra striping
- Signature-table at bottom with 28px sign-line + uppercase muted labels
- A4-feel wrapper `.agreement-doc-wrap` with subtle shadow + light grey backdrop
- Print-friendly media query

Applied via `agreement-doc-wrap` to:
- `AgreementViewerModal.jsx` (admin/partner read-only view)
- `ClientAgreementSigning.jsx` (client scroll-to-sign view)
- `AgreementGenerator.jsx` (partner step-3 preview)
- `AgreementTemplatesManager.jsx` (admin preview)

**SHA-256 Tamper Detection (Task C):**
- New module `/app/backend/core/integrity.py` with `compute_hash`, `verify_hash`, canonical PROJECTIONS per record_type (consent / signature / invoice). Hash = sha256(canonical-JSON of immutable fields).
- All 3 insert sites now persist `integrity_hash` at write-time:
  - `routers/proposal_docs.py` — invoice send + e-sign save
  - `routers/pre_assess_portal.py` — proposal-consent submit
- New endpoints in `routers/legal_archive.py`:
  - `POST /api/legal-archive/integrity/backfill` — adds hash to legacy records (admin-only)
  - `GET /api/legal-archive/integrity/verify-all` — recomputes + diffs all records, returns `{verified, tampered, unverified, tampered_records[]}` 
- `/api/legal-archive/search` now returns `integrity_status` + `integrity_hash` (12-char prefix) per item
- LegalArchive UI: "Verify Integrity" button in header, auto-fires on mount, banner shows verify/tamper counts with red-pulse alert + tampered records list. Each row gets a colored Integrity badge (green ShieldCheck for verified, red ShieldAlert pulse for tampered, slate Shield for legacy/unverified). Backfill button appears only when legacy records present.
- Tamper sanity verified: mutating `body_snapshot.final_amount` directly in Mongo → verify-all flagged 1 tampered record with expected vs actual hash diff. Restored + rehashed.

**Refactor (Task D):**
- Extracted `PaCreateForm` from `PreAssessmentPipeline.jsx` (~75 lines) → `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/PaCreateForm.jsx`
- Trimmed unused lucide imports (User, Mail, Phone, Globe, GraduationCap, Briefcase)
- Pipeline file: 1066 → 1002 lines. All data-testids preserved.

**Tested**: iteration_87.json — Backend **16/16 PASS** · Frontend 100% PASS. 0 issues. `retest_needed:false`.

### Agreement Template Library + Auto-Generator (2026-05-07 PM)

**User uploaded 3 official LEAMSS agreements** (Australia Standard, Australia Protection, Canada Express Entry). Built end-to-end Agreement Template + E-Sign system.

**Backend (`/app/backend/routers/agreement_templates.py`):**
- 2 routers: `agreement_templates_router` + `pa_agreements_router`
- 14 endpoints: list/create/edit/clone/delete/upload-docx/request templates + auto-vars/generate/list/get/sign/pdf for per-PA agreements
- 3-level taxonomy: Country × Visa Category × Policy Variant
- Jinja2 rendering with `{{var}}` placeholders (auto-detected via regex)
- python-docx integration for DOCX upload + HTML extraction
- ReportLab PDF rendering with HTMLParser (preserves headings + bold + paragraphs) + embedded canvas signature image

**Seeded 3 default templates** via `seed_agreement_templates.py`:
- Australia · PR · Standard (5 annexures, INR fees, milestones)
- Australia · PR · Protection (premium variant with 100% refund + free re-application)
- Canada · PR · Express Entry (CICC-registered retainer)

**Frontend components (3 new + 1 enhanced):**
- `AgreementTemplatesManager.jsx` (admin) — CRUD with rich-text editor, placeholder badges, DOCX upload, clone/preview/edit
- `AgreementGenerator.jsx` (partner) — 3-step modal: Select Template → Fill Variables (auto-filled, editable) → Preview & Generate
- `ClientAgreementSigning.jsx` (client) — Full agreement body preview + scroll-to-end gate + canvas signature → green signed card with download
- `AgreementViewerModal.jsx` — read-only view for already-generated agreements with regenerate option
- Enhanced `PaFinancialSummary` — added "Generate Agreement" / "View Agreement" / "Agreement Signed ✓" smart button

**Security:** Admin-only writes for templates. Partner can only generate for own PAs. Client can only sign own agreements (403 enforced at backend).

**Auto-fill placeholders** (29 vars from PA): client_name, client_email, client_phone, client_dob, client_address, client_passport, country, service_type, agreement_date, partner_name, agent_name, pa_number, pre_assessment_fee, proposal_base_fee, proposal_final_amount, promo_code, milestone_1/2/3 amount/date, payment_mode, leamss_agent_email.

**Tested**: iteration_86.json — Backend **24/24 PASS** · Frontend **95% PASS** (1 LOW priority — fixed: View Agreement button now opens dedicated viewer modal instead of generator). `retest_needed:false`.

### Legal Archive (P1) — Admin Compliance Dashboard (2026-05-07 PM)

**User ask**: P1 — Legal Archive tab with searchable consents + signatures + invoices.

**New Backend router** `/app/backend/routers/legal_archive.py` (admin-only):
- `GET /api/legal-archive/stats` — returns `{consents, signatures, invoices, total}`
- `GET /api/legal-archive/search?q=&record_type=&start_date=&end_date=` — unified timeline aggregating from 3 collections (proposal_consent_emails, pa_signatures, pa_invoices). Sorted desc by timestamp, hydrated with PA metadata (client/partner/country).
- `GET /api/legal-archive/{ref_id}` — fetch full record by reference_id
- 403 enforcement helper `_admin_only()` blocks partner/CM/client

**New Frontend component** `/app/frontend/src/components/LegalArchive.jsx`:
- 4 stat cards (Total / Consents / E-Signatures / Invoices) with colored borders
- Free-text search bar (Enter or click Search)
- Filter pills: All / Consents / Signatures / Invoices
- Date range pickers (start/end)
- Results table: Type badge + Reference ID (mono) + Client info + Country/Service + Amount (₹) + Timestamp + Actions
- View Detail modal with type-specific previews:
  - Consent: full fee snapshot (base, promo, custom discount, upsells, final)
  - Signature: IP + file size + UA
  - Invoice: download button
- Inline invoice download icon
- Export CSV button (downloads filtered results)
- Refresh button

**Wired into Admin sidebar** — System group, Shield icon. Partner sidebar excludes it.

**Tested**: iteration_85.json — Backend **17/18 PASS** (1 minor 401-vs-403 ignorable) · Frontend 100% verified · 0 issues. `retest_needed:false`.

### P0 Batch + AI Upgrade (2026-05-07) — Sonnet 4.6 + Opus 4.6 + Optimistic UI

**User asks**: P0 batch (Optimistic UI + Refactor + Lazy-load) + Hybrid AI (Sonnet 4.6 default + Opus 4.6 Premium button).

**AI Model Upgrade ✨**
- Default: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (released Feb 17, 2026 — 30-50% faster than 4.5, same price)
- Premium: `claude-opus-4-6` (deepest reasoning, for ₹5L+ proposals)
- New `premium: bool` field in `AIGenerateRequest`. Response now returns `{model, premium}`.
- Frontend shows TWO buttons in proposal form: ✨ Generate with AI (Sonnet) + 👑 Premium AI (Opus, gradient bg).

**Optimistic UI**
- All stage-changing actions now flip card stage **INSTANTLY** before server confirms:
  - Admin approve/reject (`PreAssessmentQueue.handleReview`)
  - Admin approve-final + create case (`handleApproveFinal`)
  - Partner send-proposal (`handleSendProposal`)
  - Partner forward-to-admin (`handleForwardToAdmin`)
  - Partner submit-final (`handleSubmitFinal`)
- Rollback on failure restores snapshot + toast shows ` — reverted`.

**Refactor**
- Extracted `PaFinancialSummary` (90 lines) into `/app/frontend/src/components/pa/PaFinancialSummary.jsx`. Pipeline file: 1103 → 1037 lines. Same UI / data-testids preserved.

**Lazy-load**
- `DropoffRecoveryWidget` now uses `useRef` + `IntersectionObserver` (rootMargin 100px). Shows "Scroll to load…" placeholder until visible. `/api/intelligence/dropoff-leads` no longer fires on every Home render.

**Tested**: iteration_84.json — Backend **20/20 PASS** · Frontend 100% verified. Zero issues. `retest_needed:false`.

### Performance Fix — Portal Speed + Real-time Notifications (2026-04-23 night)
**User complaint**: "Bahot slow chal raha hai pura portal. Notifications, reviews immediately update nahi ho rahe."

**Root causes found:**
1. **Missing DB indexes** — `pre_assessment_documents.pre_assessment_id`, `activity_log.entity_id`, `notifications (user_id, read, created_at)`, `pa_invoices`, `case_milestones`, etc. all did full-collection scans.
2. **API call explosion** — Expanding one PA card fired 5+ parallel calls (docs + activity + payment-history + risk + checklist).
3. **Stats endpoint serial counts** — 9 sequential `count_documents()` calls per Home page render.
4. **SSE polling 15s** — Felt "not instant" for action notifications.

**Fixes applied:**
- **10 new Mongo indexes** in `core/database.py` (including compound `(partner_id, stage)`, `(user_id, read, created_at)`, `(entity_id, created_at)`, etc.)
- **NEW bundle endpoint** `GET /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/bundle` — returns pa + documents + activity + payment_history + checklist + risk in ONE parallel-queried response.
- **Stats endpoint** now uses `asyncio.gather` for all 9 counts in parallel.
- **SSE notification poll** reduced 15s → 5s with UTC-aware datetimes.
- **Frontend components** (`PaymentHistoryTimeline`, `RiskScoreBadge`, `SmartDocChecklist`) now accept `initialData` prop to skip their own fetch when the parent has bundle data.
- **PA expand on Partner Pipeline** uses bundle directly — 1 call instead of 5+.

**Benchmark:**
- Expanding PA card: **701ms → 118ms** (~**6x faster**, 5+ calls → 1 call)
- Stats: serial → parallel (~**9x faster** on large DBs)
- Notifications: max 5s delay instead of 15s (3x more responsive)

### Latest: AI Proposal + Send Proposal 403 Fix (2026-04-23 evening)
**User issue (screenshot)**: Partner clicked "Generate with AI" → red toast "Partners or admins only"; then "Send Proposal to Client" → "Not Authorized". Reproduced via curl: backend worked correctly with fresh partner token, so issue was stale/confusing error message with no status hint.

**Root cause**: Error messages were too generic ("Not authorized", "Partners or admins only") giving no debugging hint about role vs ownership vs stage.

**Fixes applied:**
- `ai_proposal.py`: Now also accepts `case_manager` role. Error explicitly states user's actual role and required roles. Partner-ownership error now says "This pre-assessment belongs to another partner…".
- `pre_assessment.py` send-proposal: Role check and partner-ownership check split with distinct messages. Stage mismatch now says "Pre-assessment is at stage 'X'. Must be at 'approved' stage (after 1st Admin approval)".
- Frontend handleGenerateAI + handleSendProposal: Display HTTP status code + detailed detail. 401 specifically surfaces "Session expired — log in again". console.error for devtools.

**Verified via curl**:
- Partner owner → AI generate 200 (303 words) + send-proposal 200
- Client role → AI generate 403 with crystal-clear message
- Already-sent PA → send-proposal 400 with stage hint

### Phase B + C + D Complete (2026-04-23 PM) — MASSIVE RELEASE

**User ask**: Build Phase B (Proposal PDF + Digital E-Sign + Send Invoice button), Phase C (Payment History + Auto Invoice + Milestone Payments), Phase D (Drop-off Recovery + Smart Doc Checklist + Risk Prediction), plus consent-summary email auto-trigger with Reference ID for legal records.

   - `GET /api/intelligence/risk/{pa_id}` (rule-based 0-100 score using age, education, experience, stage, docs, idle time, rejection history)

**Consent Summary Email (legal paper-trail):**
- Modified `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/client/proposal-consent/{pa_id}` to emit `reference_id` (format: `CON-<PA#>-<YYMMDDHHMM>`), persist full body_snapshot (base_fee + promo + upsells + final_amount + consent_at) in `proposal_consent_emails` collection, notify both client + partner

**Tested**: iteration_83.json — Backend **49/49 PASS** · Frontend 100% · 0 regressions on Phase A · 0 issues. `retest_needed:false`.

### Latest: 3 Document UX Fixes (2026-04-23)
**User feedback**: "Document View download ho raha hai instead of inline open. Partner upload ke liye explicit Upload button chahiye aur Delete option bhi. Awaiting Final Approval stage pe Financial Summary dikhao."

**All 3 fixed:**
1. **Inline View** — Backend `GET /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/document/{doc_id}/download?inline=true` sets `Content-Disposition: inline` (via FileResponse `content_disposition_type`). Both Partner Pipeline + Admin Queue View buttons fetch with `?inline=true`, create blob URL, open in new tab. Save/Download buttons omit param (defaults to `attachment`).
2. **Explicit Upload flow** — Replaced auto-upload-on-select with 2-step staging: `pendingUpload[paId] = { file, docType }`. Selecting a file now shows filename + size + doc-type preview with explicit **Upload** + **Cancel** buttons. Applied to both `payment_received` zone + final-submit zone. data-testids: `file-input-{paId}`, `upload-btn-{paId}`, `cancel-upload-{paId}`, `final-upload-btn-{paId}`, `final-cancel-upload-{paId}`.
3. **Delete docs** — `DELETE /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/document/{doc_id}` (allowed for doc-owner client, PA's partner, admin). Frontend XCircle button with window.confirm. data-testid: `delete-doc-{docId}`.
4. **Financial Summary block** — NEW emerald gradient card visible at `proposal_paid`, `awaiting_final_approval`, `case_created` stages. Shows PA Fee ₹5,100 + Main Service breakdown (Base Fee, Promo discount with code, Custom Discount, Upsells list+total, Final Paid) + Total Received badge + Proposal notes.
5. **Awaiting Final Approval banner** — NEW indigo waiting banner at `awaiting_final_approval` stage with Hinglish subtext "Aapka role iske baad complete ho jayega".

**Tested**: iteration_82.json — Backend 29/29 PASSED, Frontend 100% verified. 0 issues. `retest_needed: false`.

## Complete Feature List (2026-04-15 to 2026-04-17)

### Latest: 5 Critical UX Fixes (2026-04-22 late night)
**User-reported issues:**
1. Partner + Admin couldn't View/Download client-uploaded documents
2. Admin 1st Approval tab didn't show approved/rejected history (only pending)
3. Partner cards at `proposal_sent` stage had no "Waiting for Client Payment" visual cue
4. Client saw blind "Pay" button without full proposal details + breakdown + consent
5. After client pays, case went straight to admin — partner couldn't upload receipt/agreement/docs first

**All 5 fixed:**
- **Doc View/Download**: NEW `GET /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/document/{doc_id}/download` endpoint. Partner + Admin cards show "View" (opens new tab) + "Save" (download) buttons per doc.
- **1st Approval history**: Admin's 1st Approval filter now includes approved/rejected/proposal_sent/etc items (visible history)
- **Waiting banner**: `proposal_sent` cards now show pulsing amber "Waiting for Client Payment" banner with client name + fee amount. Stage label renamed "Waiting for Client Payment".
- **Rich proposal + consent**: Client MiniPortal at `proposal_sent` now shows (a) AI proposal text, (b) Pricing breakdown (base, promo, discount, upsells), (c) Partner note, (d) mandatory consent checkbox with SLA + no-misleading-info language, (e) "I Agree — Unlock Payment" gate button, (f) only after consent → Pay button unlocked. Backend enforces: `mock-pay-proposal` returns 400 if `proposal_consent_given` false.
- **NEW stage `awaiting_final_approval`**: Inserted between `proposal_paid` and `case_created`. Flow: Client pays → partner notified → partner uploads payment receipt + signed agreement + basic docs → Partner "Submit to Admin for Final Approval" → stage becomes `awaiting_final_approval` → admin queue shows it → admin activates case + assigns CM.

**NEW endpoints:**
- `GET /api/pre-assessment/{pa_id}/document/{doc_id}/download` (all roles)
- `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/client/proposal-consent/{pa_id}` (client-only)
- `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/partner/submit-final/{pa_id}` (partner/admin)

**Tested**: iteration_81.json — 28/28 backend + frontend 90%+ verified. 0 issues.

### Deep-Link Filtering + Fresh DB (2026-04-22 night)
**User feedback**: "Admin Home mein '1st Approval' click kiya tho pura Pre-Assessments tab open ho raha — sirf wohi cases dikhne chahiye. Plus saare test data delete karo, fresh se test karunga."

**Solution 1 — DB Cleanup**:
- Created `/app/backend/cleanup_test_data.py` — deleted 1,315 records across 13 collections
- Preserved: 6 seeded users, products, workflows, fee_database, promo_codes, upsell_bundles

**Solution 2 — Deep-link filtering**:
- `PreAssessmentQueue` + `PreAssessmentPipeline` now accept `initialFilter` prop
- Admin/Partner action cards pass filter → opens filtered view only
- Amber context banner + Clear-filter button when filter active
- Stats cards clickable for instant filtering
- Filter auto-clears on sidebar click

**Tested**: iteration_80.json — 14/14 backend + frontend 100%, 0 issues.

### Dashboard UX Simplification + AI → Claude (2026-04-22 PM)
**Problem solved**: User was overwhelmed with 20+ tabs in Admin, 8+ in Partner — "itna complicated kyu bana hai?"

**Solution**: Action-first redesign WITHOUT deleting any feature
- **NEW `PartnerHome.jsx`**: Home tab showing greeting + 4 pulsing action cards (partner_review / approved / new_leads / proposal_paid) + Quick access tiles + Recent PAs list
- **NEW `AdminHome.jsx`**: Home tab showing greeting + 3 approval cards (1st approval, 2nd approval, unassigned cases) + Org snapshot + Quick access grid
- **NEW `FunnelProgress.jsx`**: Reusable 5-step pipeline indicator (Created → Admin Approved → Proposal Sent → Main Fee Paid → Case Active) — inserted at top of every expanded PA card

**Sidebar regroup (no deletions)**:
- Partner: `Home` → `Daily Work` (PA, Leads, Tickets) / `Sales & Earnings` (Sales, Commission, Performance) / `Tools` (Fee Calc, Classic Dashboard)
- Admin: `Home` + `Classic Dashboard` as first 2 items, all other 20+ tabs retained in existing groups
- All previously-accessible tabs still navigable

**AI switch**: GPT-5.2 → **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` via Emergent LLM key)
- Better warmth + immigration-domain empathy in proposal writing
- Model changes in `/app/backend/routers/ai_proposal.py` lines 109 + 130

**Tested**: iteration_79.json — 17/17 backend + frontend 100%, **0 regressions on any existing tab**. All user feature guarantees honoured.

### Phase A Retouch + 3 Major Features (2026-04-22)
**🔧 Critical Flow Fixes:**
- **NEW stage `partner_review`** — Between client-submit and admin-queue. Client submit → Partner gets "Action needed" notification + pink pulsing badge → Partner reviews in expanded card → Partner forwards with remarks → Admin queue
- **Partner card visibility** — Expanded card now shows 2 panels: "Client Documents" (file list + type badge) + "Client Activity" (timeline). Auto-loads on expand.
- **Strict Sales Rule** — `POST /sales` now rejects partner-created sales that lack `pre_assessment_id` UNLESS `bypass_pre_assessment=true` with `bypass_reason` (min 10 chars). Admin/CM unaffected.
- **Partner role extended** — Partner remains active through stages: new → partner_review → approved → proposal_sent → proposal_paid → **case_created (role ends here after CM assigned)**

**✨ Smart Discount Engine (wired):**
- Existing `/api/marketing/promo` CRUD + validate already backed
- Now integrated into Send Proposal form: promo code input + Apply btn + live discount preview

**📦 Upsell Bundles (new):**
- New `/api/upsell-bundles` CRUD + `/resolve` endpoint
- Auto-seeds 6 default bundles: Priority Processing ₹5k, Family Member +₹15k, Doc Courier ₹3.5k, Extended Consultation ₹8k, Mock Interview ₹4.5k, Landing Package ₹12k
- Admin UI: `UpsellBundlesManager.jsx` under Planning Tools (create/edit/delete)
- Partner UI: Checkbox grid in Proposal form; selected bundles auto-add to `upsell_total`

**✨ AI Proposal Generator (new):**
- New `/api/ai-proposal/generate` — uses **GPT-5.2** via Emergent LLM key
- Reads client profile (name, country, visa, age, education, experience, partner notes) + generates 250-380 word professional proposal body
- Tone options: professional | friendly | assertive
- Partner UI: "✨ Generate with AI" button in proposal form → auto-fills editable textarea

**📊 Enhanced Proposal Form breakdown:**
```
Base Fee:            ₹1,50,000
Promo (SAVE10 10%):  -₹15,000
Custom Discount:      -₹5,000
Upsells (2):         +₹8,000
─────────────────────────
Final Amount:        ₹1,38,000
```

**Tested**: 100% (15/15 backend + frontend all green) — iteration_78.json, 0 issues

- **NEW Partner endpoint**: `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/partner/preview-magic/{pa_id}` — short-lived (30min) magic link so partner can preview exactly what client sees in MiniPortal
- **Admin UI enhancements** (`PreAssessmentQueue.jsx`):
  - 6-card stats grid (Total, 1st Review, Approved, Rejected, Awaiting Case, Conversion)
  - `proposal_paid` items now appear in admin queue with orange "Create Case" CTA
  - 2nd-approval UI with **Case Manager dropdown** (optional assign-or-later)

### Pre-Assessment Client Portal Layer — Phase A Part 2 (2026-04-17)
- **Client MiniPortal** (`/app/frontend/src/components/PreAssessmentMiniPortal.jsx`): Beautiful stage-aware dashboard shown to clients who have a pre-assessment but no active case
  - 6-step progress pipeline (Paid → Upload → Review → Approved → Proposal → Case Active)

- **Dynamic Sidebar** (`ClientDashboard.jsx`): When `isMiniMode=true` shrinks sidebar to Overview + Tools (AI Scanner only, +Cost Estimator & Eligibility in `isExpandedMode`) + Communication + Profile
- **New Backend Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/client/submit/{pa_id}` — client marks docs as ready, stage → documents_submitted, notifies partner
  - `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/client/accept-proposal/{pa_id}` — client accepts partner's proposal
  - `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/client/mock-pay-proposal/{pa_id}` — MOCK main-fee payment, stage → proposal_paid
  - `POST /api/pre-assess-portal/admin/approve-final/{pa_id}` — admin's 2nd approval: creates real Case record + copies workflow steps, stage → case_created
- **Updated**: `GET /client/portal-access/{pa_id}` now returns `can_submit_for_review` flag; mini access_level now covers rejected/refund stages
- **Tested**: 100% (11/11 backend tests) — iteration_75.json; Frontend UI verified for multiple stages

### Pre-Assessment Client Portal Layer — Phase A Part 1 (2026-04-17)
